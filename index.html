          <p>Being born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon with a high
            level of inter-cultural communication capability attained through extensive
            travel, study and living in both developed and developing
            countries, I consider communication with people not only one of my top skills but also a great pleasure.

          <h3>Negotiation</h3>
          <p>As a young executive working with a great media agency, I was looking for a more 'high intensity' work style. I changed my job
            and entered the insurance industry. I spent two years trying to listen, sell and follow-up with clients which made me upgrade
            and enhance my negotiations skill. </p>

          <h3>Basketball</h3>
          <p>Basketball was my first love! I practiced in the morning, at night and dreamt of the sport every waking second.
          I was part of the highschool team as well as the college varsity team. Recieved various trophies and medals among them, the MVP award for the
          Alton Reynolds Basketball Tournament during my senior year in 2011. Basketball is my sport of choice. </p>
